                            In this CSE 163 Final Project, we basically want to do the Basic
                            High Quality and Real Time Rendering, as described in section 1.2 on the
                            write-up. Despite the required GLSL shaders, shadow mapping, and
                            environment mapping, we also want to do Irradiance Environment Maps and
                            also Ambient Occlusion Shader. To also approach the main purpose of
                            real-time rendering, Game, we will also write arbitrary
                            <code>.obj</code> file loader that can load relatively large scene that
                            is modeled in Blender, some material loader that can apply to different
                            objects, and a First-Person Camera that can act like in the Game.

                                <h3>OpenGL Program Structure</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Since we are aiming at a larger scale of real-time rendering
                                    program, the original Homework 2 Code in CSE 167 will not fit
                                    for our future development, so we have completely rewrote our
                                    OpenGL Program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3><code>.obj</code> File Loader</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In this project, unlike the original CSE 167 Homework 2, we want
                                    to base our models all on the <code>.obj</code> file format.
                                    Which means, even for the primitives we want to use an object
                                    file. But when we attempt to load a simple model we exported
                                    from Blender, the original file parser failed. So now we have
                                    completely rewrote a new file loader that can load various kinds
                                    of models.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Also, the original file loader cannot handle the normals in the
                                    obj files. So now we can handle those kinds of models as well,
                                    both smooth shading and flat shading. All the information comes
                                    from the obj file.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is very interesting that we have implemented a cache system.
                                    Everytime we load a file, we will store the object in the cache.
                                    So that if we want to reference that object another time, we
                                    don't have to reload the object into the VAO. We believe that
                                    this will enormously improve the performance of the program.
                                </p>

                                <h3>FPS-like Control System</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We have written a new control system. In this control system
                                    we use mouse hover to change the view direction, and we use
                                    <code>W</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>D</code>,
                                    to control the position of the camera. We can also use
                                    <code>Space</code> and <code>x</code> to go up or down, mocking
                                    the control system in the FPS Game.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Scene File Reader</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This scene file reader is pretty much the same as the original
                                    one, except that we are going to modify it to also load the
                                    <code>.mtl</code> files for object material.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>GLSL Shader</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This is exactly the requirement 1.2.1. We have implemented a
                                    basic GLSL shader pretty much like the one we had in CSE 167
                                    Homework 2.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Shadow Map</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We have done shadow 
                                </p>
                            </li>
